Next we will look at how many songs of his are in the DataFrame. We will also look at how many of his albums have made it into the DataFrame as well. We can also find out the average time length of these songs. In order to do that, we need to get the time in milliseconds, and then convert it into minutes, rounding down. After we get the conversion, we take the remainder and convert that into seconds.\n\n::: {#7e91ab06 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nLukeBryan = spotify.loc[\"Luke Bryan\"]\nnumberOfSongs = LukeBryan[\"track_name\"].nunique()\nnumberOfAlbums = LukeBryan[\"album_name\"].nunique()\naverageSongLengthInMS = float(LukeBryan[\"duration_ms\"].mean())\naverageSongLengthOfMins = int(averageSongLengthInMS / 60000)\naverageSongLengthOfSecs = int(((averageSongLengthInMS / 60000) - averageSongLengthOfMins) * 60)\naverageSongLength = str(averageSongLengthOfMins) + \":\" + str(averageSongLengthOfSecs)\nprint(\"In this DataFrame, Luke Bryan has\", numberOfSongs, \"songs, from\", numberOfAlbums, \"albums.
